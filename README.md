# QR Contact Share

QR Contact Share is a project that allows users to generate and share contact information via QR codes.

I'm trying to create an app that will alow users to share contact information with QR codes. The first part of the app that we need to implement is a screen that will allow them to input their contact information. They should be able to add various pieces of info such as phone number instagram, x, facebook, etc (social media links) as well as open-ended text. Please create a basic UI using tailwind to implement this.
